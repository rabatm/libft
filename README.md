# libft
## Your Own Custom C Library Functions
### Overview
At 42 School, libft marks the beginning of your journey through the world of software development. This foundational project challenges you to code a selection of essential C Standard Library functions while honing your skills and understanding of low-level programming. As part of the assignment, you'll also create custom utility functions that prove helpful throughout future projects.

### Goals
Throughout this project, our primary objectives include:

* Reinforcing fundamental C language concepts acquired during the initial immersive phase (piscine).
* Gaining familiarity with the C Standard Library (libc), specifically focusing on its core features.
* Learning the process of creating and integrating static libraries within larger systems.

### Key Skills Developed

During the execution of this project, expect significant improvements in these areas:

* Algorithm Design: Carefully craft algorithms using best practices, ensuring optimal performance across various scenarios.
* Attention to Detail & Rigor: Embrace precision and consistency by adhering to strict guidelines, helping you build robust and maintainable applications.
* Imperative Programming Techniques: Strengthen your mastery over procedural constructs such as loops, conditionals, and data structures.
